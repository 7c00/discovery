	    - creates directory if missing or throws error if it can't
	- ValidationAssertions
	- ServiceResource tests that also check for static services
	- More robust tests to ensure operations work properly with expected clock resolution

- CassandraStaticStore
    - Detect new vs replaced

- Time provider should be able to return time at different resolutions. Right now, it's a DateTime (ms), but Hector supports arbitrary resolution.

- Factor out keyspace & column family initialization from static/dynamic cassandra stores

- Factor out common stuff from tests -- there's lots of repetition currently, especially around creating data object to use for testing
